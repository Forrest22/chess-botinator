## Notes to self:

### Venv

I like using venv for python so here's some setup help.

`pip install virtualenv`

To create the virutual environment

`python -m venv [DIRECTORY]`

usually I use `python -m venv venv`

#### Windows

In cmd.exe

`venv\Scripts\activate.bat`

In PowerShell

`venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1`

#### Linux and MacOS

`source myvenv/bin/activate`
